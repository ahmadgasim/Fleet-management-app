I work in a company that operates in a big facility and they have a fleet of vans to facilitate the staff movement inside the big facility ... I want to use power automate to create an app that connects the vans and the staff members ... the staff can make a request in the app and the available vans drivers get a notification of which building the staff made the request at and which building the staff is heading to ... and an admin tab to register buildings, staff, and vans in the app ... better to also make it possible to register staff using phone numbers.
